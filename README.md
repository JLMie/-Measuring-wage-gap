Measuring wage gap between genders.

Data base: In this study, an analysis of an adjusted wage gap is carried out on a database prepared by the author with a total of 31 variables and a sample of 4557 fictional employees. Both the database and its analysis have been carried out with the open-source program "KNIME". 
 
Question 1: Are certain positions in a company influenced by gender? 
Conclusion: Indeed, it is concluded that being a man or woman affects whether to occupy a job.

Question 2: Are women's and men's base salary distribution the same?
Conclusion: The results show significant differences between the distribution of the base salary between men and women.

Question 3: The distribution of the base salary of women and men are similar or different?
Conclusion: With the results of this objective, we not only conclude that gender influences a person's yearly salary, but we also know how much it influences. The multivariate regression model multiplies each woman by (-9%) to estimate her total annual salary.

Since I build the database, the extrapolation of the process will likely be partial.
