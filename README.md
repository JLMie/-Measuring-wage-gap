Measuring wage gap between genders.

In this study, an analysis of an adjusted wage gap is carried out on a database prepared by the author with a total of 31 variables and a sample of 4557 fictional employees. Both the database and its analysis have been carried out with the open-source program "KNIME". 

The general goal, on the one hand, is intended to demonstrate the detection capacity and precision that can be achieved using statistical tools and techniques. On the other hand, it acts as a guide for those companies that aspire to achieve objectives similar to those formulated in this study. The specific goals of this study answer the following questions: Are certain positions in a company influenced by gender? Are women's and men's base salary distribution the same? Is the difference statistically significant? What is the percentage difference between men and women in the total annual salary?
